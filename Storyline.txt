Your first period APCS class with Mr. K...

You are snapped out of your daydream by Mr. K saying: "Alright now I'm giving the tests back!"

You anxiously wait for him to pass your test back. When he does, you eagerly turn it over to see the score.

"""
	1: Complain to your classmates about how you did so badly
		Classmate: I know what you mean. I got a 100 but I got the extra credit wrong. UGH!
		You: Deadass... I got that exactly for my physics test. She only gave me partial credit on the bonus!
		Classmate: I hate teachers that do that
		You: For real, my son... It gets me DUMB tight!!!
	2: Go talk to Mr. K about how he should curve your test up to a 99 <<MANDATORY>>
		You look around for Mr. K
		He is nowhere to be found
		The end bell rings and you go to your next class
"""

You think to yourself. I really need that 99. You silently blame the school system for all of your failures such as this most recent one, and head to math class.
Suddenly, you feel the strong urge to urinate. You make your way to the bathroom, and lo and behold, some sketchy looking people are in a circle vaping.

Vaper: Yooo, you want some xanax?

!HELP MENU: Xanax costs $3. You can trade one in with any football team member to earn +1 connections. 

"""
	1: Tell him no and walk away
		Vaper: Why u disrespectin' me?
		You: Fuck outta my face. I gotta get to my math class.
		Vaper: We goin' have a fuckin' problem
		>Fight engages
	2: Make a hand gun and try to threaten him (he's probably stoned so he won't notice the difference)
		Vaper: Whoa whoa whoa, chill man, I wasn't trying to offend you. Spare my life good sir please.
		You: Hand over the xanax
