#Welcome to the codefight! Each time you close this window your code will be aut
#omatically run with the test cases. If this window reopens, you have failed. Yo
#u can fail from either incorrect output or failing to meet the time constraints
#. If this window doesn't reopen, you passed the test! Of course, coding will be
# in python. Writing this in java was completely awful so I decided to spare you
# the pain and suffering of not having any primitives. I apologize for the awful
