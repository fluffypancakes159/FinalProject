In this game, there are many things to do, but most important of them all is to fix your Advanced Placement Computer Science grade! You will do a multitude of things in this adventure throught Stuyvesant to figure out where in the world Mr. Konstantinovich went so you can harass him about your "unfair" 98 test score.

## How to Use the Game

When you import the repository, compile using `javac *.java`.

When you are about to run the code using `java Game`, you will need a parameter after Game. The possible inputs are:

- `java Game game`, which starts the introductory cutscene.
- `java Game battle`, which is a sandbox mode to allow you to simulate a battle.
- `java Game codebattle`, which allows you to test your Python skills (yes I know this is Java code in a Java course, but whatever)

Any other input and Java will yell at you.

## How to Play the Game

This game is based around menu navigation, and you will do this by inputting **only a single number** to pick a choice. There are countermeasures to incorrect inputs, but please don't intentionally misuse the menus (unless you're Mr. K, in which case by all means), because it hurts their feelings. 

Menus such as these will appear:

1. Go up
2. Go down
3. Go right
4. Go to sleep

And let's say you want to go to sleep. You would enter in `4`, **not** `5`, but `4`.
